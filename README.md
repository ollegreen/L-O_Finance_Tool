# Purpose 
If you need to add some quantitative analysis to your portfolio, this tool helps you to indentify if you need to:
1. **Diversify your portfolio** - via a correlation matrix tool. Here you are able to analyse if your daily returns looks too similar to each other, meaning that if one of your companies goes down, your others does to. If this is the case, a common idea is that your investments are too similar to each other, and your should find similarly good companies but with returns that differ from your other investments. This is based on the efficient frontier, where we want the maximum amount of return, given the risk we are taking.

2. **Simulate your Returns based on Historical Data** -- A statistical method to simluate your returns to see what you maximum and minimum returns would be based on historical datapoints. This could give you an indication if you are being more or less risk averse than you would like, where you can adjust accordingly.
